# A C++ compendium of Bayesian statistical routines for R packages

This is a compendium of C++ routines useful for Bayesian statistics. We
steal other people's C++ code, repurpose it, and export it so developers
of R packages can use it in their C++ code. We actually don't steal
anything, or claim that Thomas Bayes did, but copy code that is
compatible with our GPL 3 licence, fully acknowledging the authorship of
the original code.
